### A tip to create tables in Markdown

Tables are created using pipes | and dashes -. For example:
| Syntax | Description|
|--- | ---|
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text|

As you can see, it can get really tedious to create huge tables with multiple rows and columns.
One easy tip would be to use HTML code to create the same table in an easy way. 
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Header</td>
    <td>Title</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Paragraph</td>
    <td>Text</td>
  </tr>
</table>
